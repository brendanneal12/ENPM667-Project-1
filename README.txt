ENPM667 Project 1 README

Student Information:
Brendan Neal - bneal12
Adam Lobo - alobo

Project Information:
Analyze and recreate results from a controls-focused academic journal paper.

Simulation Language: MATLAB and Simulink

How to Run Code:
1. Download "code" package and open in a MATLAB workspace.
2. There should be seven ".m" scripts and a folder titled "Simulink_Models" in your workspace.
3. To run the code and simulations, all you have to do is hit the green "Run" arrow at the top of the MATLAB IDE.
4. Inspect all Simulink models by clicking into the folder and opening the files.
